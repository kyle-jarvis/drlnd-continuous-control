"""
Train and run a DDPG agent in a unity environment simulating the continous
control of an actuated robotic arm.

# Algorithm 1 from DDPG paper
# Initialise critic network Q(s, a|Œ∏^Q) and actor Œº(s|Œ∏^Œº)
# Initialise target network Q' Œº' with weights
# Initialise replay buffer
# for episode i =1, M do
#  Initialise a random process ùí© for aciton exploration
#  Receive initial observation state s1
#  for t = 1, T do
#    Select action a_t = Œº(s|Œ∏^Œº) + ùí©_t
#    Execute action, observe reward r_t, observe new state s_{t+1}
#    Store transition (s_t, a_t, r_t, s_t+1) in replay buffer
